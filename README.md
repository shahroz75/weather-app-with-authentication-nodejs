Hello

Here is our assignment for Back-End development course.

We Shahroz Saeidi (L6712) and Firouz Saeidi(L6713) did this assignment in a small group.

Each of us concentrated in different parts as login-logout and adding cities as favorite but we followed and discussed all process with each other.

It takes a little more time to work and run it, if we compare with front-end running. Most of our times went to solving errors we faced.

First, we went through course material to understand the structure and materials there helped us to understand the basic and main idea. 
Then we got help from the internet to follow some steps and especially forums to solve the errors. 
Some errors happened from simple issues like mistyping but some others took time to solve. 

In the beginning, we run “ npm run dev” code which starts and run “node app.js” and connects to cloud MongoDB. 
We run dev because it updates all the time codes and in case of editing or adding codes, it automatically runs again new code and we don’t need to refresh it many times in each edit.

In case of creating a new user or adding cities, we could see that those correctly added to the MongoDB list. 
In this application, we using MongoDB cloud and we don’t run any database in our computer.

Our codes are not fully ready and we will combine different parts to each other. 
At the moment we could log in, log out, create new user, add cities as the favorite city to the city list. 

Here, an unlisted youtube video link which shows our work for this time.
